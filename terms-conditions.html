          receive, updated credit card information from your credit card issuer,
          such as updated card numbers and expiration date information when your
          credit card has expired. If such updated information is provided to us

          account information accordingly, and will use such updated information
          to process payments for your subscription(s) if you signed up for
          subscription(s). Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt
          out of providing vendors and third-party payment service providers
          with your updated credit card information. If you wish to opt out of
          your credit card’s updating service, you should contact your credit
          card issuer.<br /><br />We are not responsible for any fees or charges
          that your bank or credit card issuer may apply. If your bank or credit
          card issuer reverses a charge to your credit card, we may bill you
          directly and seek payment by another method including a mailed

          A MembershipEDU.com user is responsible for paying all sums due to
          MembershipEDU.com in connection with their monthly subscription in
          accordance with these Terms. The first fee payable in accordance with

          monthly fee is a condition of access, or after your free trial ends
          and you have not canceled the automatic subscription with us. Every
          calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus
          applicable tax for the following month’s subscription, together with
          any other fees for the following month’s subscription plus any
          accumulated charges for the past period (collectively “Fees”).<br /><br />Failure
          by the MembershipEDU.com user to use any of the services available
          through the service provided by MembershipEDU.com does not relieve the
          MembershipEDU.com user of their payment obligations under these Terms.
          Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card. Payment details
          shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection
          mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the
          transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of
          the card used to purchase the products or services together with
          details on when payment is due.<br /><br />You further acknowledge and
          agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with
          the payment  terms for the specific service purchased (unless the
          subscription is canceled in accordance with these Terms)  and
          therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable
          to that specific service (e.g., on a  monthly basis and for a specific
          amount).<br /><br />IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR MembershipEDU.com
          SUBSCRIPTION (INCLUDING SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SERVICES) AT ANY TIME AFTER
          A FREE TRIAL OR DISCOUNTED PERIOD ENDS, YOU MUST SUBMIT A CANCELLATION
          REQUEST TO US VIA OUR SUPPORT EMAIL ADDRESS support@membershipedu.com
          OR THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT DASHBOARD, AS DETAILED HERE. FOR MONTHLY
          SUBSCRIPTIONS (INCLUDING SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SERVICES), WE REQUIRE AT
          LEAST TEN (10) DAYS’ NOTICE OF CANCELLATION BY EMAIL. IF YOU PROVIDE
          SUCH NOTICE LESS THAN TEN (10) DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT
          SUBSCRIPTION MONTH.<br /><br />MembershipEDU.com reserves the right to
          immediately terminate a user’s account and/or service for any unpaid
          (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without

          from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the
          event MembershipEDU.com starts collection processes of any type, you
          will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and

          resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the

          rendered may be entered in any court having  jurisdiction thereof. We
          agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will
          also be subject to his arbitration provision, except as provided in
          Sections 20 and 21 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a
          single neutral arbitrator in the English language in United States
          Jurisdiction , unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by
          telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by
          agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in
          accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in
          accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration
          Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the
          demand for arbitration. The AAA’s Rules are available at www.adr.org
          or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive
          and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
          interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or
          enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the
          Privacy Statement, this arbitration provision, and any other terms
          incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and
          Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to
          determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have
          the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration
          agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement
          and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this
          provision against you or MembershipEDU.com.<br /><br />Payment of all
          filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
          AAA’s Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their
          own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited
          to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.<br /><br />The
          arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Texas
          without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered
          shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final,
          subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16,
          as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
          entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  <br /><br />You and
          MembershipEDU.com agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an
          individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide,
          representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other
          proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
          You and MembershipEDU.com expressly waive any right to pursue any
          class or other representative action against each other.  <br /><br />Failure
          or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection
          with any particular claim will not  constitute a waiver of any rights
          to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other
          claims  except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the
          claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120 day informal
          resolution procedures described above).  <br /><br />This arbitration
          provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to
          final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and
          enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as
          amended.  <br /><br />This provision survives termination of your
          account or relationship with MembershipEDU.com, bankruptcy,
          assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed
          unenforceable (<em>i.e.</em>, unenforceability would allow arbitration
          to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire
          arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not
          apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the
          class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions
          of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and
          effect.<br /><br />YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD
          HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY
          DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
          HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED
          INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL
          ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.
