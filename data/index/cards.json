      },
      {
        "question": "Is this program only for people with tech experience?",
        "answer": "Not at all. Many of our students started in retail, help desk, or other non-technical roles. If you’re willing to learn and take action, we’ll guide you through everything."

        "question": "Why Cloud Engineering?",
        "answer": "It’s one of the most in-demand, high-paying, and remote-friendly paths in tech. The barrier to entry is lower than you think when you have the right roadmap."

        "question": "How can a tech career give me more freedom in life?",
        "answer": "A high-paying cloud engineering role puts you in control, working remotely, earning what you're truly worth, more time freedom, and designing a life on your terms. No degree needed. No years of climbing the corporate ladder."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this really something anyone can do?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you’re willing to put in the work. Many of our students started with zero tech background. Our mentorship and step-by-step roadmap bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why Cloud Engineering specifically?",
        "answer": "It’s one of the fastest growing, highest paying paths in tech. Demand is high, remote work is standard, and the skillset is transferable across industries."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why focus on hands-on learning?",
        "answer": "Because it works. Real projects prove to employers you can do the job. That’s what leads to interviews and offers, not just certifications or theory."
      },
      {
        "question": "Isn’t the tech industry too crowded?",
        "answer": "Only if you follow the crowd. Most people are stuck chasing certs with no direction. We give you a proven system, personal mentorship, and the tools to stand out fast."
