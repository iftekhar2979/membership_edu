          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-4">
            <strong>The 1% University, LLC</strong>, and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, <em>"The 1% University,"</em> the <em>"Company,"</em> <em>"We,"</em> or <em>"Us"</em>) is a cloud computing education and mentorship company. We do not sell a business opportunity, <em>"get rich quick"</em> program or money-making system. We believe, with education, individuals can be better prepared to make career transition decisions and advance in the technology field, but we do not and cannot guarantee career success or specific employment outcomes. We do not make earnings claims, efforts claims, return on investment claims, or claims that our training will make you any specific amount of money or guarantee job placement.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-6">
            Training generally includes a hybrid of education, mentorship, hands-on projects, certification preparation, and career support tools/resources. All material is intellectual property and protected by copyright. Any duplication, reproduction, or distribution is strictly prohibited.

          <h3 class="bold-text-17 mb-4">Examples, Case Studies, and Hypothetical Scenarios</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-6">
            The Company makes no representation regarding the likelihood or probability that any actual or hypothetical investment in the training will achieve a particular career outcome or perform in any predictable manner. Any career success information in the Company presentation and materials do not represent the actual performance of any specific client's experience. Past performance is not a guarantee of future success and career outcomes in any period may be far above or below those of a previous period. No representation is being made that any career transition will or is likely to achieve salary increases or job placements like those achieved in the past, or that significant career setbacks will be avoided. Career transitions involve risk, and you could experience periods of unemployment or reduced income. Examples and hypothetical scenarios used in the Company presentation and materials may include information compiled from third-party sources. The Company believes the third-party information comes from reliable sources but does not guarantee its accuracy.

          <h3 class="bold-text-17 mb-4">Lending and Financing</h3>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-6">
            The Company is not a lender, does not issue credit, and is not a credit counselor or provide consulting services related to acquiring lines of credit. Lenders and consulting firms are independently owned and operated and are otherwise not affiliated with the Company. The Company does not receive referral fees, or any compensation related to lending or other services provided by these independent parties. You should carefully evaluate your own financial situation, objectives, consequences, risks, and other relevant circumstances before borrowing funds or purchasing consulting services. <strong>The 1% University</strong> assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of independent parties. Using borrowed money to make investments into training or to purchase any other product or service at high-interest rates or terms may significantly reduce the return you receive on any investment in education or may even cause you to lose more money than you invested. The Company urges you to carefully consider using borrowed money before making an investment decision. If you cannot make required minimum payments to the bank and/or lenders, you may incur additional fees and risk damage to your credit profile.

          <h2 class="bold-text-17 mb-4">Customer Satisfaction Surveys</h2>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-4">
            To continually improve the customer experience, we survey our customers often. Nevertheless, it is difficult to track and ascertain those who implement and complete the training. Some customers attend the training for education purposes only – and do not pursue career transitions immediately – but may be included in satisfaction survey results.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-4">
            Testimonials and reviews are individual experiences and personal opinions of those who have purchased education and training. Individual results will vary, and testimonials and/or reviews may not be typical. Results rely on individual effort, time, dedication, and skill of each customer, as well as market conditions, prior experience, and other factors. The Company does not track specific salary outcomes or job placement rates. Instead, it surveys customers concerning the value of its education, training, support, and overall satisfaction. Survey results are comprised of an average rating across all products and services within a 12-month period.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-6">
            You may be asked to complete a satisfaction survey. By completing a survey, you confirm that the information contained is an accurate representation of your experience and that you have not received any financial incentive to give positive feedback. Further, you give the Company permission to publish your aggregate feedback and comments, on your behalf, to the Company's website(s), materials, and various online review outlets. We respect your privacy and will not publish personally identifiable information.

          <ul class="paragraph-51 mb-6" style="list-style: disc inside; padding-left: 1.25rem;">

            <li><strong>Career-Focused Language:</strong> Updated investment language to career transition and technology field advancement</li>
            <li><strong>Specific Disclaimers:</strong> Modified to reflect career outcomes, salary increases, and job placement rather than financial returns</li>

            <li><strong>Survey Context:</strong> Updated to reflect education satisfaction rather than monetary tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Statements:</strong> Adapted to career transition risks (unemployment, reduced income) rather than investment risks</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p class="paragraph-51 mb-6">
            This version now accurately reflects <strong>The 1% University</strong>'s focus on cloud computing education and career development while maintaining all necessary legal protections and disclaimers.
