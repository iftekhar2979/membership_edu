            >WHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM
          </strong>
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph-51">
          We may collect personal information from the following groups of data
          subjects: visitors to, and users of, our online and mobile resources;
          our customers; current members of our workforce and those who apply
          for posted jobs; and third-party vendors and business partners.
          <br />‍<br />‍<strong>Personal information </strong>generally means
          information that can be used to identify you or that can be easily
          linked to you (for example, your name, address, telephone number,
          email address, social security number and date of birth). The privacy
          laws in some jurisdictions include unique elements in what they
          consider to be the personal information of the consumers or data
          subjects they protect. If those laws apply to us, as in the case of
          the Georgia Consumer Privacy Act (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”) or European
          General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”), our use
          of the phrase “personal information” includes the unique elements
          required by such laws. <br /><br />The categories of information we
          collect from each of these groups, and the ways in which we use it,
          differs. As you may have noticed, it’s possible that the same person
          could fall into more than one group. Most of this statement addresses
          our processing and sharing of personal information collected from
          visitors to and users of our online and mobile resources and our
          customers. <br /><br />Nonetheless<strong>, </strong>we collect and
          retain the types of
          <strong
            >professional or employment related personal information </strong
          >you would expect an employer to have about its existing and former
          workforce and new job applicants. We provide legally required notices
          of collection and describe our use and sharing of the personal
          information of our workforce and applicants in greater detail in
          confidential internal human resource manuals and documents accessible
          to members of our workforce, or by publication on the proprietary
          workforce/applicant portals and apps we operate. In some cases, such
          portals and apps may be operated by third parties who transfer the
          personal information to us. <br /><br />In those situations, the legal
          responsibility to provide notice usually rests with the third party,
          not us. In addition, like all corporate enterprises, we buy goods and
          services, lease equipment and office space and attend industry events.
          In doing so, we interact with many existing and potential
          <strong>vendors and business partners </strong>from whom we
          necessarily collect certain personal information in connection with
          our contractual and business relationships. As with our customers,
          this information is typically limited to minimum business contact
          information. We use and share personal information collected from our
          vendors and business partners to manage, administer and perform under
          our contracts with them, or share information about our products. We
          describe our use of vendor and business partner personal information
          in greater detail in our confidential contracts with those parties or
          on the internal vendor management portals we operate
        </p>
        <h1><strong class="bold-text-17">WHAT WE COLLECT</strong></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-51">
          There are two types of information that we obtain from you online and
          then store and use: (i) non-personal information that’s collected
          automatically from each visitor, such as your device operating system;
          and (ii) personal information that you voluntarily provide to us or
          that is collected automatically. <br /><br /><strong
            ><em
              >By using our online and mobile resources or purchasing our
              products or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with
              this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and
              disclose your information as described</em
            ></strong
          >.<br /><br /><em
            >Voluntarily Submitted Information. <br />‍<br />‍</em
          >If you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile
          resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about
          yourself. The types of personal information we collect in those
          situations includes <strong>identifiers </strong>(such as your name,
          email address, physical address, and phone number),
          <strong>professional information </strong>(such as the business you
          are in), and <strong>financial account information </strong>(such as
          your credit card information). We do not sell, rent, or trade
          voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.<br />‍<br />If
          you don’t want us to collect this type of personal information, please
          don’t provide it. This means you shouldn’t participate in the
          activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require
          it and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail
          instead. Participation is strictly your choice. Not participating may
          limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile
          resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain
          information available to the general public on the online and mobile
          resources.<br /><br />Some of the ways you voluntarily give us your
          personal information and how we use it: <br /><br />‍<strong
            >Emails and Online Forms – </strong
          >When you send us an email or fill out an online form, such as to
          contact us, your email address and any other personal information
          (e.g., home address or phone number) that may be in the content of
          your message or attached to it, are retained by us and used to respond
          back directly to you and to process your request. Depending on the
          personal information provided, communications from us may be in the
          form of emails, telephone calls, and/or text messages. We may also
          send you information about any of our products or services we think
          may be of interest to you. <br /><br /><strong
            >Registering for an Account – </strong
          >When you register for an account or you register your child for a
          sub-account, you submit personal information to us such as your name
          and email address (or your child’s name and email address) which we
          then retain. We use that information to create and manage your account
          and, in some cases, establish a password and profile to communicate
          with you and any sub-accounts you created via email.<br /><br /><strong
            >Registering for Events – </strong
          >When you register for services, webinars, events, conferences, or
          programs we ourselves may host (rather than outsource to a third-party
          event manager with its own privacy policies), you will be submitting
          the types of identifiers described above. If the event requires a fee,
          we may also ask you to submit
          <strong>credit card or other financial information</strong>. We use
          this information to register you for the event and send you
          communications regarding the event.<br />‍<br /><strong
            >Becoming a Subscriber to Our Service – </strong
          >We use any information provided from our customers to perform our
          contractual obligations and provide the products and services
          purchased to them, to manage their accounts and communicate with
          them.<br /><br /><strong
            >Social Media and Community Features – </strong
          >Some of our online and mobile resources may offer social media-like
          community features letting users post messages and comments, and/or
          upload an image or other files and materials. If you choose to make
          use of these features, the information you post, including your screen
          name and any other personal information, will be in the public domain
          and
          <strong>not covered/protected by this statement</strong
          >.<br /><br /><em
            >Automatically Collected Information. <br /><br />‍</em
          >When you visit our online and mobile resources, basic information is
          passively collected through your web browser via use of tracking
          technologies, such as a “cookie” which is a small text file that is
          downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you access the
          online and mobile resources. It allows us to recognize your computer
          or mobile device and store some information about your preferences or
          past actions. <br /><br />We allow third party vendors to use cookies
          or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing
          activities over time following your use of the site. For example, we
          use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
          (&quot;<strong>Google</strong>&quot;). Google Analytics uses cookies
          to help us analyze how you use the online and mobile resources and
          enhance your experience when you visit the online and mobile
          resources. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to
          www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can learn more about
          how to opt out of Google Analytics by going to
          https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.<br /><br />The internet
          activity information collected through cookies and other similar means
          includes such things as: the domain name and IP address from which you
          accessed our online and mobile resources; the type of browser and
          operating system you use; the date and time and length of your visit;
          the specific page visited, graphics viewed and any documents
          downloaded; the specific links to other sites you accessed from our
          online and mobile resources; and the specific links from other sites
          you used to access our online and mobile resources.<br /><br />Additionally,
          if you access our online and mobile resources from a phone or other
          mobile device, the mobile services provider may transmit to us
          uniquely identifiable mobile device information which allows us to
          then collect mobile phone numbers and associate them with the mobile
          device identification information. Some mobile phone vendors also
          operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices and we
          may receive this information as well if location services are enabled
          on your device. If you do not want us to collect and use
          <strong>geolocation data</strong>, disable location services through
          your device settings.<br /><br />Regardless, we use both automatically
          collected information and mobile device information to compile generic
          reports about popular pages on our online and mobile resources, and to
          see how our customers and followers are accessing our online and
          mobile resources. We then use that data to administer the online and
          mobile resources and make them better, make your activities more
          convenient and efficient and to enhance the functionality of our
          online and mobile resources, such as by remembering certain of your
          information in order to save you time.<br /><br />We use and retain
          your personal information in accordance with applicable law and as
          long as necessary to carry out the purposes described above in
          accordance with our internal data retention procedures.<br /><br /><em
            >User Beware: External Sites, Apps, Links and Social Media.
            <br /><br />‍</em
          >We maintain a presence on one or more external social media platforms
          such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and LinkedIn. We may further allow
          features of our online and mobile resources to connect with, or be
          viewable from, that external social media presence. Similarly, our
          online and mobile resources may contain links to other websites or
          apps controlled by third parties.<br /><br />We are not responsible
          for either the content on, or the privacy practices of, social media
          platforms, or any third-party sites or apps to which we link. Those
          apps, sites and platforms are not controlled by us and therefore have
          their own privacy policies and terms of use. If you have questions
          about how those apps, sites and platforms collect and use personal
          information, you should carefully read their privacy policies and

          You do not have to provide personal information to enjoy most of the
          features of our online and mobile resources. Moreover, you can opt out
          of certain activities like newsletters and announcements. Residents of
          Georgia and data subjects whose personal information was obtained
          while they were in the GDPR Jurisdictions have certain additional
          rights. <strong><br /><br />GDPR Jurisdictions </strong>means the
          countries composed of the European Economic Area (including Iceland,
          Lichtenstein, and Norway) and the following countries: Austria,
          Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
          Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
          Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
          Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.  <br /><br />Furthermore,
          Andorra, Argentina, Canada (only commercial organizations), Faroe
          Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand,

          GDPR. Switzerland also has its own data protection via its Federal Act
          of Data Protection (“DPA”). <br /><br />‍<strong

          >. Since the United Kingdom (“UK”) has now formally left the European
          Union, it is no longer regulated domestically by the material terms of
          the GDPR.  The United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation
          (“UK-GDPR”) is the UK&#x27;s data privacy law that governs the
          processing of personal data domestically. <br /><br />If we are using
          personal information you provided to us in order to enable us to send
          you materials, such as newsletters or product alerts via text or
          email, and you decide you don’t want to receive such materials, you
          may opt out by following the opt-out instructions in the email or
          other communication (e.g., by responding to the text with “STOP”), or
          by contacting us using the contact information below. <br /><br />When
          we receive your request, we will take reasonable steps to remove your
          name from our distribution lists. You need to understand it may take a
          period to remove your name from our lists after your request and due
          to such latency, you may still receive materials for a period of time
          after you opt out. In addition to opting out, you have the ability to
          access, amend, and delete your personal information by contacting us
          using the contact information below.<br /><br />Some browsers have a
          “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not
          want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not
          specifically respond to browser “do not track” signals.
