            >WHO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM
          </strong>
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph-51">
          We may collect personal information from the following groups of data
          subjects: visitors to, and users of, our online resources; our
          customers and program participants; current members of our workforce
          and those who apply for posted jobs; and third-party vendors and
          business partners.
          <br />‍<br />‍<strong>Personal information </strong> generally means
          information that can be used to identify you or that can be easily
          linked to you (for example, your name, address, telephone number,
          email address, and date of birth). The privacy laws in some
          jurisdictions include unique elements in what they consider to be the
          personal information of the consumers or data subjects they protect.
          If those laws apply to us, as in the case of the California Consumer
          Privacy Act(“<strong>CCPA</strong>”) or European General Data
          Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”), our use of the phrase
          “personal information” includes the unique elements required by such
          laws. <br /><br />
          The categories of information we collect from each of these groups,
          and the ways in which we use it, differs. As you may have noticed,
          it's possible that the same person could fall into more than one
          group. Most of this statement addresses our processing and sharing of
          personal information collected from visitors to and users of our
          online resources and our customers. 
        <h1><strong class="bold-text-17">WHAT WE COLLECT</strong></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-51">
          There are two types of information that we obtain from you online and then store and use: (i) non-personal information that's collected automatically from each visitor, such as your device operating system; and (ii) personal information that you voluntarily provide to us or that is collected automatically.

              >By using our online resources or purchasing our cloud computing education programs or services, you are signifying to us that you agree with this section of our privacy statement and that we may use and disclose your information as described.

          <em
            >Voluntarily Submitted Information. <br />‍<br />‍</em
          >If you participate in certain activities via our online and mobile
          resources, you may be asked to provide us with information about
          yourself. The types of personal information we collect in those
          situations includes <strong>identifiers </strong>(such as your name,
          email address, physical address, and phone number),
          <strong>professional information </strong>(such as the business you
          are in), and <strong>financial account information </strong>(such as
          your credit card information). We do not sell, rent, or trade
          voluntarily submitted personal information with third parties.<br />‍<br />If
          you don’t want us to collect this type of personal information, please
          don’t provide it. This means you shouldn’t participate in the
          activities on our online and mobile resources that request or require
          it and you may want to communicate with us by phone or regular mail
          instead. Participation is strictly your choice. Not participating may
          limit your ability to take full advantage of the online and mobile
          resources, but it will not affect your ability to access certain
          information available to the general public on the online and mobile
          resources.<br /><br />Some of the ways you voluntarily give us your
          personal information and how we use it: <br /><br />‍<strong
            >Emails and Online Forms – </strong
          >When you send us an email or fill out an online form, such as to
          contact us, your email address and any other personal information
          (e.g., home address or phone number) that may be in the content of
          your message or attached to it, are retained by us and used to respond
          back directly to you and to process your request. Depending on the
          personal information provided, communications from us may be in the
          form of emails, telephone calls, and/or text messages. We may also
          send you information about any of our products or services we think
          may be of interest to you. <br /><br /><strong
            >Program Registration  – </strong
          >When you register for our cloud computing education programs, bootcamps, or mentorship services, you submit personal information to us such as your name, email address, and phone number which we then retain. We use that information to provide our educational services, manage your program participation, and communicate with you about your progress and opportunities.
          <br /><br /><strong
            >Registering for Events – </strong
          >When you register for our weekly live coaching calls, webinars, masterclasses, or other educational events, you will be submitting the types of identifiers described above. We use this information to register you for the event and send you communications regarding the event.

          <strong>credit card or other financial information</strong>. We use
          this information to register you for the event and send you
          communications regarding the event.<br />‍<br /><strong
            >Becoming a Subscriber to Our Service – </strong
          >We use any information provided from our customers to perform our
          contractual obligations and provide the products and services
          purchased to them, to manage their accounts and communicate with
          them.<br /><br /><strong
            >Payment Processing – </strong
          >When you purchase our programs, we collect payment information through our payment processors (Stripe and PayPal). We do not store credit card information on our servers; this information is securely processed by our payment partners.
